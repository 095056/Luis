We are currently using github actions for building and uploading packages to a repository hosted by [FossHost](https://fosshost.org/). Thanks to this, the main infrastructure does not incur any costs for individual developers.

Consider making a donation to show appreciation and support the work (as in development or maintenance) of the various contributors. Even a small amount (for a cup of coffee) is greatly appreciated. Look at the git history and repository statistics ([termux-packages](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/graphs/contributors), [termux-app](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/graphs/contributors)) to see all the people that have put time and effort into the packages and apps.
