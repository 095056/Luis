## Generating bootstrap archives

Bootstrap archives is a zip archives of `$TERMUX_PREFIX` with basic packages
preinstalled and used to create a minimal working environment on first start
of Termux application.

Normally, bootstrap zip archives are being generated by executing this script:
```
./scripts/generate-bootstraps.sh
```
Built archives will be available in the current working directory.

Please note that you must have an `apt` repository deployed on the web server
in order to be able to generate bootstrap archives. 

Default script configuration is
```
Architectures: aarch64 arm i686 x86_64
Repository URL: https://packages.termux.org/apt/termux-main/
```
so if you want to generate bootstraps for custom repository, consider using
following command line options:

- `--architectures` - Comma separated list of architectures for which bootstraps
  should be generated.

- `--repository` - URL of your APT repository. Offline bootstrap generation is not
  supported.
