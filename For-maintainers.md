  Verify that all binaries are using PIE, which is required for Android 5+.

- `./scripts/check-versions.sh`:
  Check for package updates.

- `./scripts/ldd`:
  Print list of required shared libraries for given binary.

- `./scripts/lint-packages.sh`:
  Do basic checks for problems in `build.sh` scripts.

- `./scripts/list-packages.sh`:
  List all packages with a one-line summary.

- `./scripts/package_uploader.sh`:
  Upload packages to Bintray.

- `./scripts/generate-bootstraps.sh`:
  Generate bootstrap archive for Termux app.

## Uploading packages (Bintray)

Upload is done by executing script `./scripts/package_uploader.sh` with package
name as argument. Note that \*.deb files must have name in format `{name}_{full-version}_{arch}.deb`.
It is expected that \*.deb files are located in `./debs`, but can be changed by
passing argument `-p /path/to/deb_dir`.

Example:
```
./scripts/package_uploader.sh -p ./my_built_packages bash
```

Authentication credentials are supplied through environment variables:

`BINTRAY_USERNAME`        - User name on [Bintray](https://bintray.com).

`BINTRAY_API_KEY`         - Personal API key on [Bintray](https://bintray.com).

`BINTRAY_GPG_PASSPHRASE`  - A passphrase for your GPG key stored on [Bintray](https://bintray.com).

Any operations (except download) on APT repository can be done only by
maintainers who have *write* access.

### Deleting packages

To delete package from APT repository, use pass argument `-d` with list of
package names to `package_uploader.sh`:
```
./scripts/package_uploader.sh -d {package names}
```

### Deleting old versions

*We keep old versions only for technical reasons - to prevent 404 errors when
users download packages.*

Pass argument `-c` with list of packages which should be cleaned. Example:
```
./scripts/package_uploader.sh -c bash busybox coreutils libllvm
```

**Warning:** never clean versions when \*.deb files for specific architectures
were not updated. This will made package unavailable for some devices.

### Regenerating metadata

In certain cases you may need to force-regenerate metadata. This can be done in
following way:
```
./scripts/package_uploader.sh -r
```

### Avoid parallel uploads and simultaneous `package_uploader.sh` sessions generally.

Never run multiple instances of `package_uploader.sh`. This may lead to corruption of metadata or whole APT repository.

If you have `package_uploader.sh` running and you want to perform another action, wait until job finish or stop already running instance with Ctrl-C.It also better to wait 1-5 minutes after `package_uploader.sh` termination as Bintray doesn't generate metadata immediately.

## Generating bootstrap archives

Bootstrap archives is a zip archives of `$TERMUX_PREFIX` with basic packages
preinstalled and used to create a minimal working environment on first start
of Termux application.

Normally, bootstrap zip archives are being generated by executing this script:
```
./scripts/generate-bootstraps.sh
```
Built archives will be available in the current working directory.

Please note that you must have an `apt` repository deployed on the web server
in order to be able to generate bootstrap archives. 

Default script configuration is
```
Architectures: aarch64 arm i686 x86_64
Repository URL: https://dl.bintray.com/termux/termux-packages-24
```
so if you want to generate bootstraps for custom repository, consider using
following command line options:

- `--architectures` - Comma separated list of architectures for which bootstraps
  should be generated.

- `--repository` - URL of your APT repository. Offline bootstrap generation is not
  supported.
